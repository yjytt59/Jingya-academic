Jingya a postdoctoral researcher in the Singapore-ETH Centre at ETH Zurich, where I am working on the Digital Underground. Currently, my research focuses on 3D data model for utility networks. To be able to have both above surface and underground data in a single, consolidated and possibly integrated database, a data model for the 3D representation and storage of underground utility network data is required. There is geometry of existing underground utilities in 2D with semantics available. This information must be standardised. The data model should be capable of representing 3D information, integrating (2D) data provided by data suppliers (e.g. land surveyors, utility infrastructure owners) and supporting the use cases that have been identified (e.g. urban planning, governance).
